https://github.com/Ianshaw93/exchange-directory/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Crypto Exchange Directory showing the top ten Centralized exchanges and corresponding details. Coded using Typescript, Next js (React), Tailwind CSS and tested using Cypress and Jest. API layer included for fetches from Coingecko API.

# App so Far

From the main directory page users will be able to navigate to any of the crytocurrency exchange pages where further info and social links/ links to the exchange site are available.

# Future Features

* Allow users to star favourite exchanges and include signin to remember preferences
* Improve on clean but basic UI - including add colour scheme, logo, perhaps use three js for 3d graphics looking through telescope and zooming into crypto currency icons 
* Add further Cypress end to end tests to focus on social links

# What I Learned

* Implementation of an API layer
* Next js routing
* Cypress end to end testing framework
* Jest unit testing
* Integration of typescript into the above
