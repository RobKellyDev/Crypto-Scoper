# Future Features

* Allow users to star favourite exchanges and include signin to remember preferences
* Improve on clean but basic UI - including build on colour scheme, perhaps use three js for 3d graphics looking through telescope and zooming into crypto currency icons 
* Add further Cypress end to end tests to focus on social links

# What I Learned

* Implementation of an API layer
* Next js dynamic routing
* Cypress end to end testing framework
* Jest unit testing
* Integration of typescript into the above
